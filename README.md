## Overview
This repository is organized to provide hands-on examples and practice problems for:
- Core Python syntax and features
- Data structures (lists, stacks, queues, trees, hash tables)
- Algorithms (sorting, searching, recursion)
- Functional programming (lambda, decorators, generators, iterators)
- Web scraping and concurrency (threading, asyncio, multiprocessing)
- Regular expressions and string manipulation
- Miscellaneous utilities and mini-projects

## How to Use
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/mujtabaalmas/Python3.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the project folder:**
   ```
   cd Python3/python_practice
   ```
3. **Run any script using Python 3:**
   ```
   python script_name.py
   ```
   Replace `script_name.py` with the file you want to run.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Some scripts may require additional packages:
  - `requests` (for API calls)
  - Others as needed (see script comments)

Install requirements using pip:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
